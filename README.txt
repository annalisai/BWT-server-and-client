# Client-Server BWT Project

This project implements a client-server system for string transformation using the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) algorithm. It is divided into two main files:

- **Server.py**: Contains the implementation of the server that handles client requests.
- **Client.py**: Contains the implementation of the client that sends requests to the server.

## Project Scope
The aim of the project is to demonstrate the implementation of a client-server system for BWT, allowing users to send strings to the server for transformation and receive the result.

## Execution Instructions
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run the server using the `Server.py` file.
3. Run the client using the `Client.py` file.
4. Follow the instructions displayed in the output of the programs to interact with the system.

For further details on the implementation and usage of the system, refer to the source code of the `Server.py` and `Client.py` files.
